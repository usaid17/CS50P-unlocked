# 🗝️ Harvard's CS50P Unlocked

Welcome to my CS50P journey! 👋
This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from [**CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), a free online course by Harvard University.

Each challenge helped me explore Python, problem-solving, and core computer science concepts. 🧠💡

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

Each problem includes:

* 📄 A `.md` file – the original question
* 🐍 A `.py` file – my Python solution

Files are organized week by week, following the CS50P curriculum.

## 🚀 Why I Made This

I'm building this repo to:

* 🧱 Strengthen my Python fundamentals
* 📓 Track my learning progress
* 🌍 Share knowledge with other learners

> ✨ **Note**: This repository is for educational purposes. Please don’t copy directly for course submissions—learn, explore, and grow! 🙂
