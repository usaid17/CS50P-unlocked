# 🗝️ Harvard's CS50 Unlocked

Welcome! 👋
This repo contains my solutions to the problem sets from [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), a free course by Harvard University.

I'm using this space to document my journey as I learn the basics of programming and Python—one problem at a time. Each problem includes:

* 📄 A `.md` file with the original question
* 🐍 A `.py` file with my solution

## 📚 What's in the Repo?

You'll find folders or files organized by week or topic. I'm currently working through the course, and I’ll keep updating this as I go!

> This is a **learning-focused repo**. Feel free to explore the code, compare approaches, or learn along—but please don’t copy directly for submissions.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

* To practice coding in Python 🧠
* To stay consistent and track my progress 📈
* To help others who might be learning too 🌱
